* `is_newsworthy` (0-1 scale): Measures the significance of the content based on how many people it affects, the disruption it may cause, and how unexpected it is within the industry.
* `is_service` (0-1 scale): Likelihood that the content is educational or how-to journalism.
* `is_roundup` (0-1 scale): Likelihood that the content summarizes multiple topics, determined by the presence of diverse themes and external links.
